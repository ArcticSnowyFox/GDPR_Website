        <p class="text">That what you create is owned by you as long as it meets some level of originality.</p>
        <p class="text bold">How long does copyright last?</p>
        <p class="text">Your lifetime and 70 years after your death.</p>
        <p class="text bold">Is there any difference in rights when using others' material for private
            compared to public use?</p>
        <p class="text">Private use is when you create something for yourself without sharing it with the world, so
            copyright does not apply here as it is not shared. <br> Public use is
            when you share it with the world, so you need too comply with copyright laws.</p>
        <p class="text bold">Can you use (publish, etc.) a picture of another person without their consent?</p>
        <p class="text">Sharing a picture of someone without their consent would break <a href="GDPR.html"
                class="tex">GDPR</a> because the picture is considered personal data</p>
        <p class="text bold">Explain what is meant by Creative Commons.</p>
        <p class="text">The Creator retains the rights and ownership of their work but others can freely use it if they
            credit the creator.</p>
